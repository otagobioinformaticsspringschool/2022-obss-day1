## Getting ready to use R for the first time

In this lesson we will take you through the very first things you need to get
R working.


> ## Tip: RStudio
> 
> In the original lessons, they made use of a software called [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/),
> an [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment).
> RStudio, like most IDEs, provides a graphical interface to R, making it more
> user-friendly, and providing dozens of useful features.
>
> For the Otago Bioinformatics Spring School, we will be using R through the Juypter notebooks.
>
> If you are not working on NeSI it is highly recommended to use RStudio and follow the [original lessons](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-r-intro/01-introduction/index.html).

## A Brief History of R

[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) has been around
since 1995, and was created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University
of Auckland, New Zealand. R is based off the S programming language developed
at Bell Labs and was developed to teach intro statistics. See this [slide deck](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/Massey.pdf)
by Ross Ihaka for more info on the subject.

## Advantages of using R

At more than 20 years old, R is fairly mature and [growing in popularity](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/r/). However, programming isnâ€™t a popularity contest. Here are key advantages of
analyzing data in R:

 - **R is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)**.
   This means R is free - an advantage if you are at an institution where you
   have to pay for your own MATLAB or SAS license. Open source, is important to
   your colleagues in parts of the world where expensive software in
   inaccessible. It also means that R is actively developed by a community (see
   [r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/)),
   and there are regular updates.
 - **R is widely used**. Ok, maybe programming is a popularity contest. Because,
   R is used in many areas (not just bioinformatics), you are more likely to
   find help online when you need it. Chances are, almost any error message you
   run into, someone else has already experienced.
- **R is powerful**. R runs on multiple platforms (Windows/MacOS/Linux). It can
   work with much larger datasets than popular spreadsheet programs like
   Microsoft Excel, and because of its scripting capabilities is far more
   reproducible. Also, there are thousands of available software packages for
   science, including genomics and other areas of life science.

> ## Discussion: Your experience
>
> What has motivated you to learn R? Have you had a research question for which
> spreadsheet programs such as Excel have proven difficult to use, or where the
> size of the data set created issues?

## Creating your first R notebook

After logging into the [NeSI Jupyter lab](../01-nesi/index.html), open an R (v4.1) notebook.

<img src="../fig/jupyter_launcher.png" alt="jupyter launcher window" style="width: 1000px;"/>



Now that we are ready to start exploring R, we will want to keep a record of the
commands we are using in out notebook. Lets first save our new notebook.

Click the <kbd>File</kbd> menu and select <kbd>Save Notebook As</kbd> and then call it
`intro_r.ipynb`. By convention, notebooks end with the file extension **.ipynb**.

## Overview of the R notebook layout

Here are the main features of the notebook environment:

<img src="../fig/r_notebook.png" alt="r notebook default session" style="width: 1000px;"/>


Some useful keyboard shortcuts:
- To run the current cell: <KBD>Shift</KBD> + <KBD>ENTER</KBD>
- To insert a new cell above the current cell: <KBD>ESC</KBD> + <KBD>A</KBD>
- To insert a new cell below the current cell: <KBD>ESC</KBD> + <KBD>B</KBD>






>## You are working with R
> Although we won't be working with R at the terminal, there are lots of reasons
> to. For example, once you have written an RScript, you can run it at any Linux
> or Windows terminal without the need to start up RStudio. We don't want
> you to get confused - Jupyter or RStudio runs R, but R is not RStudio or Jupyter. For more on
> running an R Script at the terminal see this [Software Carpentry lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/05-cmdline/).

## Getting to work with R: navigating directories
Now that we have covered the more aesthetic aspects of Jupyter notebooks, we can get to
work using some commands. We will write, execute, and save the commands we
learn in our notebook.
First, lets see what directory we are in. To do so, type the following command
into the cell:


~~~
getwd()
~~~
{: .language-r}

To execute this command, make sure your cursor is on the same line the command
is written. Then click the <KBD>Run</KBD> (play) button that is just above the first
line of your notebook in the header.


In the output, we expect to see the following output*:

~~~
[1] "'/scale_wlg_persistent/filesets/home/murray.cadzow/.jupyter/jobs/23207554'"
~~~
{: .output}


Since we will be learning several commands, we may already want to keep some
short notes in our notebook to explain the purpose of the command. Entering a `#`
before any line in a cell turns that line into a comment, which R will
not try to interpret as code. Edit your cell to include a comment on the
purpose of commands you are learning, e.g.:


~~~
# this command shows the current working directory
getwd()
~~~
{: .language-r}

> ## Exercise: Work interactively in R
>
> What happens when you try to enter the `getwd()` command in the Console pane?
>
>> ## Solution
>> You will get the same output you did as when you ran `getwd()` from the
>> source. You can run any command in the Console, however, executing it from
>> the source script will make it easier for us to record what we have done,
>> and ultimately run an entire script, instead of entering commands one-by-one.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
For the purposes of this exercise we want you to be in the directory `"~/obss_2022/intro_r"`.
What if you weren't? You can set your home directory using the `setwd()`
command. Enter this command in your script, but *don't run* this yet.


~~~
# This sets the working directory
setwd()
~~~
{: .language-r}

You may have guessed, you need to tell the `setwd()` command
what directory you want to set as your working directory. To do so, inside of
the parentheses, open a set of quotes. Inside the quotes enter a `~/` which is
your home directory for Linux. Next, use the <KBD>Tab</KBD> key, to take
advantage of the Tab-autocompletion method, to select `obss_2022`, and `intro_r` directory. The path in your script should look like this:


~~~
# This sets the working directory
setwd("~/obss_2022/intro_r")
~~~
{: .language-r}

When you run this command, the console repeats the command, but gives you no
output. Instead, you see the blank R prompt: `>`. Congratulations! Although it
seems small, knowing what your working directory is and being able to set your
working directory is the first step to analyzing your data.

> ## Tip: Never use `setwd()`

## Using functions in R, without needing to master them

A function in R (or any computing language) is a short
program that takes some input and returns some output. Functions may seem like an advanced topic (and they are), but you have already
used at least one function in R. `getwd()` is a function! The next sections will help you understand what is happening in
any R script.

> ## Exercise: What do these functions do?
>
> Try the following functions by writing them in your script. See if you can
> guess what they do, and make sure to add comments to your script about your
> assumed purpose.
> - `dir()`
> - `sessionInfo()`
> - `date()`
> - `Sys.time()`
>
>> ## Solution
>> - `dir()` # Lists files in the working directory
>> - `sessionInfo()` # Gives the version of R and additional info including
>>    on attached packages
>> - `date()` # Gives the current date
>> - `Sys.time()` # Gives the current time
>>
>> *Notice*: Commands are case sensitive!
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
You have hopefully noticed a pattern - an R
function has three key properties:
- Functions have a name (e.g. `dir`, `getwd`); note that functions are case
  sensitive!
- Following the name, functions have a pair of `()`
- Inside the parentheses, a function may take 0 or more arguments

An argument may be a specific input for your function and/or may modify the
function's behavior. For example the function `round()` will round a number
with a decimal:


~~~
# This will round a number to the nearest integer
round(3.14)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 3
~~~
{: .output}

## Getting help with function arguments

What if you wanted to round to one significant digit? `round()` can
do this, but you may first need to read the help to find out how. To see the help
(In R sometimes also called a "vignette") enter a `?` in front of the function
name:


~~~
?round()
~~~
{: .language-r}

The "Help" tab will show you information (often, too much information). You
will slowly learn how to read and make sense of help files. Checking the "Usage" or "Examples"
headings is often a good place to look first. If you look under "Arguments," we
also see what arguments we can pass to this function to modify its behavior.
You can also see a function's argument using the `args()` function:


~~~
args(round)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
function (x, digits = 0) 
NULL
~~~
{: .output}

`round()` takes two arguments, `x`, which is the number to be
rounded, and a
`digits` argument. The `=` sign indicates that a default (in this case 0) is
already set. Since `x` is not set, `round()` requires we provide it, in contrast
to `digits` where R will use the default value 0 unless you explicitly provide
a different value. We can explicitly set the digits parameter when we call the
function:


~~~
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 3.14
~~~
{: .output}

Or, R accepts what we call "positional arguments", if you pass a function
arguments separated by commas, R assumes that they are in the order you saw
when we used `args()`. In the case below that means that `x` is 3.14159 and
digits is 2.


~~~
round(3.14159, 2)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 3.14
~~~
{: .output}

Finally, what if you are using `?` to get help for a function in a package not installed on your system, such as when you are running a script which has dependencies.


~~~
?geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}

will return an error:

~~~
Error in .helpForCall(topicExpr, parent.frame()) :
   no methods for â€˜geom_pointâ€™ and no documentation for it as a function
~~~
{: .error}

Use two question marks (i.e. `??geom_point()`) and R will return
results from a search of the documentation for packages you have installed on your computer
in the "Help" tab. Finally, if you think there
should be a function, for example a statistical test, but you aren't
sure what it is called in R, or what functions may be available, use
the `help.search()` function.

> ## Exercise: Searching for R functions
> Use `help.search()` to find R functions for the following statistical
> functions. Remember to put your search query in quotes inside the function's
> parentheses.
>
> - Chi-Squared test
> - Student t-test
> - mixed linear model
>
>> ## Solution
>>   While your search results may return several tests, we list a few you might
>>   find:
>> - Chi-Squared test: `stats::Chisquare`
>> - Student t-test: `stats::t.test`
>> - mixed linear model: `stats::lm.glm`
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

We will discuss more on where to look for the libraries and packages that contain functions you want to use. For now, be aware that two important ones are [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) - the main repository for R, and [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) - a popular repository for bioinformatics-related R packages.
